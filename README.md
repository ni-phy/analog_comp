The code aims to use inverse design to develop non-reciprocal analogue computers. This is achieved through the introduction of gyrotropic media. The inverse design utilises a combination of gradient-free and gradient-based optimisers, along with the introduction of a stochastic element in the optmisation process.

Paper under review.
First code commit is original code by Heedong.
