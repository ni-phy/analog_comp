The data used are as follows:

Particles v Cost.csv is the cost for each particle size, first column indicated particle size, second cost for gyrotropic
particles and third for PEC particles.

The data from each optimisation process are in 'Data for Each Scatterer'
-The data are seperated in folders depending on the number of particles in each analog computer.

-Each folder has both non-reciprocal and reciprocal computers

-non-reciprocal are labeled as data_NUM_TYPE.data, reciprocal are labeled as data_pec_NUM_TYPE.data

-where (a)NUM is the number of particles, (b)TYPE is the type of data: pos for position, 
mult for the multiplied SA matrices, multiplier for the optimised multiplier, scat (S) for scattering and,
stif (A) for it's inverse.
